Agenor Core version *4.3.0* is now available from:  <https://github.com/AgenorCore/Agenor/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/AgenorCore/Agenor/issues>


Recommended Update
==============

This version is an optional, but recommended, update for all users and services.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Agenor-Qt (on Mac) or agenord/agenor-qt (on Linux).

Downgrading warning
-------------------

The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous releases, so if you run 4.3.0 and then decide to switch back to any older version, you will need to run the old release with the -reindex option to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.


Compatibility
==============

Agenor Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). Agenor Core software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.

Agenor Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.


Notable Changes
==============

Performance Improvements
------------------------

Version 4.3.0 contains a number of significant performance improvements, which make Initial Block Download, startup, transaction and block validation much faster:

- The chainstate database (which is used for tracking UTXOs) has been changed from a per-transaction model to a per-output model ([See PR 1801](https://github.com/AgenorCore/Agenor/pull/1801)). Advantages of this model are that it:
  - avoids the CPU overhead of deserializing and serializing the unused outputs;
  - has more predictable memory usage;
  - uses simpler code;
  - is adaptable to various future cache flushing strategies.
  
  As a result, validating the blockchain during Initial Block Download (IBD) and reindex is ~30-40% faster, uses 10-20% less memory, and flushes to disk far less frequently. The only downside is that the on-disk database is 15% larger. During the conversion from the previous format a few extra gigabytes may be used.

- LevelDB has been upgraded to version 1.22 ([See PR 1738](https://github.com/AgenorCore/Agenor/pull/1738)). This version contains hardware acceleration for CRC on architectures supporting SSE 4.2. As a result, synchronization and block validation are now faster.

Removal of Priority Estimation
------------------------------

Estimation of "priority" needed for a transaction to be included within a target number of blocks has been removed.  The rpc calls are deprecated and will either return `-1` or `1e24` appropriately. 

The format for fee_estimates.dat has also changed to no longer save these priority estimates. It will automatically be converted to the new format which is not readable by prior versions of the software.

Dedicated mnping logging category
---------------------------------

`mnping` related debug log messages have been moved to their own category of the same name. This is to reduce log spam when debugging with the `masternode` category enabled.

RPC Changes
------------

### Modified input/output for existing commands

- The new database model no longer stores information about transaction
  versions of unspent outputs. This means that:
  - The `gettxout` RPC no longer has a `version` field in the response.
  - The `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC reports `hash_serialized_2` instead of `hash_serialized`,
    which does not commit to the transaction versions of unspent outputs, but does
    commit to the height and coinbase/coinstake information.
  - The `getutxos` REST path no longer reports the `txvers` field in JSON format,
    and always reports 0 for transaction versions in the binary format
- Three filtering options for the `getbalance` command have been reinstated:
  - `minconf` (numeric) Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.
  - `includeWatchonly` (bool) Also include balance in watchonly addresses.
  - `includeDelegated` (bool) Also include balance delegated to cold stakers.
- `estimatefee` is now deprecated and replaced by `estimatesmartfee`:
  - Input argument is the same for `estimatesmartfee`.
  - Output is now a JSON object with 2 fields: `feerate` and `blocks`
- The `getrawmempool` RPC command now includes an additional output field:
  - `modifiedfee` (numeric) transaction fee with fee deltas used for mining priority.::ZZZZexit
  

### Removed commands

The following commands have been removed from the interface:
- `estimatepriority`
